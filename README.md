# Chloe's Python Projects
This is a repository dedicated to projects that I've done using Python. Difficulty ranges from beginner to advance.

### [Higher Lower Game](https://github.com/miantingwang/python_projects/tree/main/beginner/higher-lower-game)
Description: Which of these celebrities/social media accounts have more followers on Instagram? Take a guess!

### [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/miantingwang/python_projects/tree/main/beginner/number-guessing-game)
Description: Guess which number between 0 and 100 the computer is thinking. Try to guess it correctly within 10 attempts (Easy Mode) or 5 attempts (Hard Mode)!

### [The Coffee Machine Simulator](https://github.com/miantingwang/python_projects/tree/main/beginner/coffee-machine)
Description: This simple program simulates a coffee machine. To order a cup of espresso/latte/cappuccino, simply type the name of the coffee when prompted. After that, you will be prompted to insert your coins. The machine will take care of the rest! To check the remaining ingredients in the machine, type "report". To turn off the machine, type "off".
